# i-met-these-errors-while-coding-with-python
1. No module named 'pywintypes after installing "pyttsx3" (Text to Speech):

Tbh I'm not sure how this error was solved. What I did just:

+ search for answers on Stackoverflow but none of them helps
+ ask my friend but she didn't reply
+ write some bad commands in Command Prompt then be terrified by what appeared next on the screen
+ shut down the computer and go to sleep

and the next day my code run magically :)???

2. can't import pyaudio windows

again be terrified by what showed up on the screen while installing pyaudio.

But luckily I have a perfect answer on StackOverFlow hohoo

          pip install pipwin
          pipwin install pyaudio
